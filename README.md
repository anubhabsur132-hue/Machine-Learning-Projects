# Machine-Learning-Projects
These ML projects are on Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting.

Dataset are gathered from different sources like Kaggel, scikit-learn datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis is done with pandas numpy library.
For data visualization matplotlib and seaborn libraries are used.
Hyper parameter tuning is done using gridsearchsv, randomizedsearchcv with multiple parameters.
There are evaluations on the model using metrics like accuracy.
